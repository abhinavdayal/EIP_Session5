# EIP_Session5

Thanks for this wonderful assignment. Honestly, I was too busy and could not do justice to this assignment. But following are the things I tried:

1. I understood to great extent how to implement subclassed models. However I did not go beyond Davidnet. But tries to implement Cyclic LR, Data sugmentation, and different gradient calculations for different outputs. 
2. I saw some errors in data. For example people with back pose had emotion other than neutral. So I made that all Neutral. Also I saw that some classes were heavily skewed, so I added some more examples via augmentation of other classes.
3. I tried all ways sequestial (theough someone else as I didnt have time to do it myself), functigonal and subclassing. Larger models were giving OOM error and thus have to revert to smaller networks or deeper with separable conv only.
